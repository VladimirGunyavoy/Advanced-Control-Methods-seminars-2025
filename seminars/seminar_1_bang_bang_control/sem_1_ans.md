### Problem 3: Acceleration Control by Variants
- [Solution in Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rpaq75ttlt)
- Different starting positions
- Different starting speeds
- Different finishing conditions

In this model:
- The k indicator shows the area
- You can change the switching time
- You can change the finishing time
- You can change the initial acceleration
- There are 9 different variants, with variant 10 being universal
- Variable g is for a special case

### Problem 3: Universal Solution
- [Solution in Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kfdvir7dps?lang=ru)
- Solves for any area of initial states
- You can drag the green point "State" for different initial conditions

### Plot Generator
- [Code in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1svjSiBcK5cCZ2ykVEje-vD4uFnX7DgY5?usp=sharing)
- Generates different trajectories of bang-bang stabilizations
- The code generates and saves images that you can find in the working directory
